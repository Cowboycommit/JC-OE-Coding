# Domain-Specific Stopwords
# =========================
#
# This file contains domain-specific stopwords discovered from your corpus.
# These are words that appear frequently across documents but do not carry
# semantic meaning for distinguishing topics or clusters.
#
# USAGE:
# - Add one word per line, lowercase
# - Lines starting with # are comments (ignored)
# - Empty lines are ignored
# - This file is loaded by the stopwords discovery module
#
# WORKFLOW:
# 1. Run the discovery pipeline with only general stopwords
# 2. Inspect the candidate report generated by find_domain_stopword_candidates()
# 3. Review words that appear in >70-90% of documents
# 4. Add non-informative, operational vocabulary below
# 5. Re-run the pipeline and observe improved topic separation
#
# CRITERIA for adding a word here:
# - Appears in >70% of documents
# - Has very low TF-IDF variance across documents
# - Appears across all/most topics
# - Does not differentiate clusters
# - Is operational or procedural language
#
# EXAMPLES by domain:
#
# Healthcare feedback:
#   patient, doctor, treatment, hospital, care, visit, appointment
#
# Survey responses:
#   response, survey, question, please, thanks, participant
#
# Support tickets:
#   ticket, issue, help, support, request, problem
#
# Market research:
#   product, brand, customer, service, company
#
# DO NOT add words that:
# - Carry semantic meaning
# - Are domain-specific but informative
# - Define the topic space
# - Help differentiate clusters
