# Custom content sections (optional overrides for generated text)
custom_sections:
  methodology_intro: |
    This document provides comprehensive methodology documentation for the
    Open-Ended Coding Analysis Framework. The framework leverages machine learning
    and natural language processing techniques to automatically analyze qualitative
    text data, identifying themes, patterns, and insights that would traditionally
    require manual coding.

  analysis_description: |
    The framework employs a multi-stage analytical approach:
    1. Text preprocessing and normalization
    2. Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization
    3. Unsupervised clustering (K-Means, hierarchical)
    4. Topic modeling (LDA, NMF)
    5. Theme validation and refinement
    6. Results visualization and export

  input_spec_overview: |
    This document specifies the input data requirements for the Open-Ended
    Coding Analysis Framework. Proper data formatting ensures accurate analysis
    and reliable results. The framework accepts various file formats and can
    handle datasets ranging from hundreds to millions of text responses.

  reporting_intro: |
    This document establishes visualization and reporting standards for the
    Open-Ended Coding Analysis Framework. Consistent reporting practices ensure
    that analysis results are clearly communicated and easily interpreted by
    stakeholders across different contexts.

  tools_intro: |
    This document reviews the open-source libraries and tools that power the
    Open-Ended Coding Analysis Framework. Each tool has been selected for its
    reliability, performance, and compatibility with the framework's objectives.
